    "# Planning for the overall mass-ratio estimation code\n",
    "This notebook is for planning how to do forward modeling to measure the mass-ratio distribution. I need code to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Model the data given certain parameters:\n",
    "    - Physical Parameters:\n",
    "      - Overall multiplicity rate\n",
    "      - mass-ratio distribution $$P(q) \\sim q^{\\Gamma}$$\n",
    "      - Seperation distribution - lognormal: $$P(a) = \\frac{1}{a\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{(\\ln{a} - \\mu)^2 / 2\\sigma^2}$$\n",
    "      - eccentricity distribution - Power law $$P(e) \\sim e^{\\alpha}$$\n",
    "    - Observational Parameters\n",
    "      - Sample bias\n",
    "        - Malmquist\n",
    "        - Do I have any other sampling biases?\n",
    "      - Detection bias\n",
    "        - Each target has a detection rate as a function of companion temperature\n",
    "          - The rate estimate comes from 17 samples, so has an uncertainty coming from binomial statistics. Use HelperFunctions.BinomialErrors(n_detected, 17) \n",
    "          - The rate also depends on how well we know the primary temperature. Can that be parameterized in some way?\n",
    "        - separation cutoff: I cannot detect companions more than about 1\" from the primary. The exact cutoff is different for each star, but I can probably treat it as just an instrument-specific parameter\n",
    "      - False positives\n",
    "        - Astrophysical (i.e. background sources)\n",
    "        - Other (spurious CCF peaks, etc). This should depend on the number of observations. It also depends on the companion temperature (can that be parameterized?)\n",
    "        \n",
    "  - My detections have the following properties\n",
    "    - temperature estimate, with error bars\n",
    "      - This can turn into a mass estimate using spectral-type relationships, assuming the companion is MS. That makes adds further uncertainty because of the accuracy of the MS relationship, not to mention the question of whether the companions *are* MS!\n",
    "      - Going through the primary properties can then give the mass-ratio, with additional uncertainties coming from uncertainty in the primary star properties.\n",
    "    - $N_{obs}$ measurements of the velocity of both the primary and secondary stars\n",
    "      - The measurements should not be assumed to be in the same rest frame\n",
    "      - $N_{obs} >= 1$. If only one measurement, I can't directly measure the mass-ratio\n",
    "    - $N_{img}$ direct imaging measurements. These do a few things:\n",
    "      1. If I detect the companion, I get a $\\Delta m$ and projected separation measurement.\n",
    "      2. If I don't I get some form of an upper limit on the separation distribution. (STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST MEASURE THAT! PROBABLY SIGNAL INJECTION/RECOVERY)\n",
    "      \n",
    "  - I need to determine the best physical parameters ($\\Gamma, \\mu, \\sigma, \\alpha$, multiplicity rate)\n",
    "    - Given the parameters, I should be able to randomly sample several instances of my experiment.\n",
    "      - Each should give me N detections, each with some set of properties\n",
    "    - How to calculate the fitness/likelihood of the given parameters? I need to know how similar my data are to the simulated data, but don't want to go through histograms or something that is binning-specific.\n",
